# Missing Attachments - Issue Diagnosis & Fix

## 🔍 Problem Identified

The missing attachments feature is not loading data because:

### **Root Causes:**

1. **Most companies are missing `organization_name` and `tenant_id`** (40 out of 41 companies)
   - These fields are required for fetching data from Xero
   - Without `tenant_id`, the system cannot make API calls to Xero
   - Without `organization_name`, the UI cannot display which organization the data belongs to

2. **Most companies have NO access tokens or refresh tokens**
   - 37 out of 41 companies have no OAuth tokens at all
   - These companies configured Client ID/Secret but never completed the OAuth flow

3. **Some companies have expired access tokens**
   - Company #7, #41, #56, #54 have expired access tokens
   - These will auto-refresh if refresh tokens are still valid

4. **One company (ID: 54 - "sds") is fully configured**
   - Has organization name: "Demo Company (Global)"
   - Has tenant ID: `0525fe61-e8ef-4f1b-92f5-4ba5d5eb8e5c`
   - Has valid access and refresh tokens
   - ✅ This company should be able to use missing attachments feature

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### **Backend Fixes (Already Deployed):**

1. **OAuth callback now saves tenant data** (`src/controllers/xeroController.js`)
   - Saves `tenant_id` from Xero API response
   - Saves `organization_name` from tenant data
   - Saves `tenant_data` as JSONB for future use

2. **Database migration added** (`src/utils/migrate.js`)
   - Added `organization_name VARCHAR(255)` column
   - Added `tenant_data JSONB` column
   - These columns are created automatically on server restart

3. **Error handling improved** (`src/controllers/missingAttachmentController.js`)
   - Returns 401 for expired tokens (instead of 500)
   - Returns clear error messages
   - Includes reconnection flags for frontend

## 🔧 Required Actions

### **For ALL Companies (Except Company #54):**

Users need to **disconnect and reconnect to Xero** to populate the missing fields.

### **Steps to Fix:**

1. **Go to Xero Integration page**
2. **Click "Disconnect from Xero"** (if connected)
3. **Click "Connect to Xero"**
4. **Complete OAuth flow**
5. **Xero redirects back with tenant data**
6. **Backend saves `organization_name` and `tenant_id`**
7. ✅ **Missing attachments will now work**

## 🎯 Testing the Fix

### **For Company #54 ("sds"):**

This company is already fully configured. Test the missing attachments feature:

```bash
# Test detect endpoint
curl -X GET https://compliance-manager-backend.onrender.com/api/missing-attachments/detect \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <COMPANY_54_JWT_TOKEN>"
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "totalTransactions": X,
    "highRiskCount": Y,
    "lowRiskCount": Z,
    "transactions": [...]
  },
  "message": "Found X transactions without attachments"
}
```

### **For Other Companies:**

Until they reconnect, they will receive:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Xero connection has expired. Please reconnect to Xero to continue.",
  "error": "XERO_TOKEN_EXPIRED",
  "requiresReconnection": true
}
```

## 🚀 How to Reconnect (For Users)

### **Option 1: Via Frontend UI**

1. Navigate to **Xero Integration** page
2. If already connected, click **"Disconnect from Xero"**
3. Click **"Connect to Xero"** button
4. Authorize on Xero's OAuth page
5. You'll be redirected back with success message
6. Organization name will now display
7. Missing attachments feature will now work

### **Option 2: Via API (For Testing)**

```bash
# Step 1: Get auth URL
curl -X GET https://compliance-manager-backend.onrender.com/api/xero/login \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_JWT_TOKEN>"

# Step 2: Visit the authUrl in browser
# Step 3: Authorize on Xero
# Step 4: Xero redirects to /redirecturl with tenant data
# Step 5: Backend saves organization_name and tenant_id
```

## 🔍 Verification

After reconnecting, verify the data is saved:

```sql
SELECT 
  company_id,
  organization_name,
  tenant_id,
  access_token IS NOT NULL as has_token
FROM xero_settings 
WHERE company_id = <YOUR_COMPANY_ID>;
```

**Expected Result:**
```
company_id | organization_name      | tenant_id                              | has_token
-----------+------------------------+---------------------------------------+-----------
67         | Your Company Name      | abc-123-def-456                       | t
```

## 📝 Why This Happened

### **Timeline:**

1. **Before:** Companies configured Xero with Client ID/Secret only
2. **Issue:** OAuth callback didn't save `tenant_id` and `organization_name`
3. **Result:** Companies completed OAuth but missing data wasn't saved
4. **Fix:** Updated OAuth callback to save tenant data (Oct 8, 2025)
5. **Migration:** Added database columns for `organization_name` and `tenant_data`

### **Why Now:**

The missing attachments feature requires:
- `tenant_id` → To make API calls to correct Xero organization
- `organization_name` → To display which organization in UI
- `access_token` → To authenticate API requests
- `refresh_token` → To refresh expired access tokens

Without these, the service cannot fetch transaction data from Xero.

## 📋 Checklist for Each Company

- [ ] Has `client_id` and `client_secret` configured
- [ ] Has completed OAuth flow (has `access_token` and `refresh_token`)
- [ ] Has `tenant_id` saved (from OAuth callback)
- [ ] Has `organization_name` saved (from OAuth callback)
- [ ] Access token not expired (or has valid refresh token)
- [ ] Missing attachment config enabled (if using feature)

**All items must be ✅ for missing attachments to work**

## 📞 Support

If issues persist after reconnection:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Check server logs for Xero API errors
