# Role-Based Xero Integration Guide

## üéØ **Overview**

This implementation provides a **role-based Xero credential management system** where:

- **Super Admins** manage Xero credentials for all companies
- **Admin users** get specific messages when credentials are missing
- **Admin users** can either contact Super Admin or connect directly to Xero
- **Regular companies** can connect their Xero accounts normally

---

## üîê **Role System**

### **Super Admin**
- **Responsibility**: Add and save Client ID and Client Secret for all companies
- **Access**: Full credential management interface
- **Cannot**: Connect their own Xero account (restricted)

### **Admin**
- **Check**: System validates if they have credentials configured
- **Missing Credentials**: Shows specific message with options
- **Options**: Contact Super Admin OR connect directly to Xero
- **Message**: "Your account does not have the required Client ID or Client Secret configured for login. Please contact your Super Admin to have the credentials added to your account. Meanwhile, you can proceed by directly connecting to Xero for login."

### **Regular Company**
- **Access**: Standard Xero integration
- **Flow**: Direct connection to Xero account

---

## üöÄ **Backend Implementation**

### **Enhanced APIs Added:**

1. **`POST /api/xero/settings`** (Super Admin only)
   - Creates/updates Xero credentials for any company
   - Requires `companyId` in request body
   - Only Super Admin can access

2. **`GET /api/xero/admin/companies`** (Super Admin only)
   - Lists all companies with Xero status
   - Shows who has credentials configured

3. **`GET /api/xero/admin/check-credentials`** (Admin only)
   - Validates if Admin has credentials
   - Returns specific message for missing credentials

4. **Enhanced `GET /api/xero/login`**
   - Validates Admin credentials before OAuth
   - Returns specific error for missing Admin credentials

### **Key Backend Changes:**

```javascript
// Admin credential validation in buildAuthUrl
if (req.company.role === 'admin') {
  const adminXeroSettings = await XeroSettings.getByCompanyId(companyId);
  if (!adminXeroSettings) {
    return res.status(400).json({
      success: false,
      message: 'Your account does not have the required Client ID or Client Secret configured for login. Please contact your Super Admin to have the credentials added to your account. Meanwhile, you can proceed by directly connecting to Xero for login.',
      errorCode: 'ADMIN_CREDENTIALS_MISSING',
      action: 'contact_super_admin_or_direct_connect'
    });
  }
}
```
